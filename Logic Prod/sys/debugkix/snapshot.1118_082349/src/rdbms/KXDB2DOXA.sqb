      * Sample COBOL program which contains entry points for
      * interfacing UniKix's user exits with db26000 software. The main
      * entry point(KXDB2LGN) is for logging onto the db26000 server and
      * is called by the UniKix transaction processors
      * and batch vsam processor when they are
      * initiated by the UniKix system. Entry point KXDB2LGF is for
      * disconnecting from the db26000 server and is called by the UniKix 
      * transaction processors and batch vsam processors when they terminate.
      *
      * Entry point KXDB2SAVE is for executing an SQL COMMIT statement and
      * will be called at UniKix sync point time. If the user COBOL programs
      * are already doing COMMITs, then this statement will have no effect.
      * Entry point KXDB2UNDO is for executing an SQL ROLLBACK statement and
      * will be called at UniKix rollback time. If the user COBOL programs
      * are already doing ROLLBACKs, then this statement will have no effect.
